Analysis that I made includes three variables, total production level as dependent and computer 
and high technology product productions I wanted to study these two variables change in time
how is going to affect the total production. The data is taken from TCMB website with period of 
first month of 2010 to second month of 2022 so we can say that the data is up to date. Study 
investigates the stationary of the series with unit roots test, correlograms VAR analysis, 
Cointegration tests and impulse response analysis.
